          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i
          got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. i've been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun!I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life.Since completing
          the course,i've successfully switched careers, working as a Software
          Engineer at a VR startup."
